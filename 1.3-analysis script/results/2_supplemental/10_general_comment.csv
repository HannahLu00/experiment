"27",79,"Although all these additional data are extremely interesting to know and have in real-time, I am not sure how they could be displayed on a screen because there are already many of them on TV. I fear that they would hide the course itself.
Then, would these data be shared with the swimmers and the coaches so that they can benefit from them?"

"30",84,"The data must be presented at the appropriate time in the race. Sometime we have info showing up in the screen, we don't know what it is for, then the race start we do realize what the info was but it is too late the info disapear and we cannot see it anymore. 
Too many info to read at the same time is difficult to process, however visual informtion are simpler to get (line, mouving information etc..) because no need to understand what they are, the data speaks by themself"

"73",177,"I was an elite level coach and a highly published author at the same time and this study is very exciting.  Having a mechanism that will display many of the really subtle yet interesting facts during and after a race.  The type of data your study will present has been confined to a select few and really has the potential to increase the fan appeal for swimming.  With the way the new streaming services work it is really hard sometimes to even get to watch some of the big international events.  Right now the World Swimming Championships are going on and it was not easy to watch the event live, or even see post race video posted because of copyright issues.  How can we grow viewership if it is hard to find.  Your technology could really unlock a view of swimming even if we can¡¯t see the race, we can see what happened.  All viewers usually ever get is some arbitrary analysis from a former swimmer broadcasters that really give dated information. Your study will add a level of sophistication to our sport similar to what ¡°Moneyball¡± did for baseball. If you know what that is?  

 I wish you great success with your study!  If you would like any further feedback from someone that was really inside the sport, please feel free to contact me.

Swimming is already a sport where you see the entire body and it is known that many swimmers have had experiences with bullying because of there body and bulimia. Therefore I do not recommend this question at all. Cheers from a concerned coach."
